# archinstallv2

Thank you for having a look at my simple install script for Arch Linux.

This script gives the user a small, simple bash interface with a permenant header, scrolling centre section and progress bars at bottom of the screen.

I have put this script together in order to simplify the re-installation of my own Arch Linux based systems. It is a work in progress and will be updated when I believe it is necessary based on my requirements.

I took inspiration and have based the script on the follownig sources:

## Based on the following scripts & guides:
## tommytran732 install script
## ordinatechnic "an-arch-linux-installation-on-a-btrfs-filesystem-with-snapper-for-system-snapshots-and-rollbacks" article 
## Stephan Raabe arch install scripts

All of the above are great guides that are freely available and well worth a look.
